        <p>Sky has been one of the first curious things in our childhood. The first question of every child looking up at the sky are “Why does the moon walk along with me? Why do some stars twinkle while others don’t? Why is their a Rabbit on the moon?” and a lot more. You are lying if you don’t admit that you haven’t thought of being an Astronaut on growing up at one point or other of your childhood. But then comes the schooling and the cut-throat competition of life and we forget the wonders of the sky. Krittika is a place where you can revive the child in you and look up at the sky. Its a group of astronomy enthusiasts who admire the vastness of the sky, the Sun, the planets, the moon, the stars, the galaxies and a lot more. Our vision is threefold:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To generate enthusiasm in people for astronomy and astrophysics- The universe is a beautiful creation and getting to understand it better and know about its mysteries is really interesting and fun. The feeling of seeing Galaxies and clusters in the sky with your own eyes through the telescope is something which can’t be explained. We want everyone at IITB to experience this pleasure of a lifetime.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To bring Interested people together - We at Krittika aim at forming a community of astronomy enthusiasts where students can share anything interesting regarding space and get solution of any question that is troubling them. Since its a community of students even mistakes would be welcome. This group can also be used to share information regarding any astronomy events or competitions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To equip Interested students with Basic Knowledge - Because of no formal education in astronomy in our early life lot of us haven’t been able to pursue our interests. We at Krittika aim to conduct various events to familiarize the interested audience with the basic theoretical and practical concepts of Astronomy and Astrophysics. We will tell you about the skies, teach you how to operate a telescopes and a lot more.</p>
